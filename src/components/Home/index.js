At a distance you can see the animals peacefully grazing while you are enjoying your food. Post your breakfast, proceed again on the game drive. Mid mornings while the Lions sleep is a good time to look around for the cheetahs. November is also the season when the Topis give birth to young ones.

Today you would be going towards the border of Maasai Mara. You would be going for a full day game drive with packed breakfast and lunch. Sand river is the border for Maasai Mara and Tanzania. This has been the entry point of the migratory animals for millions of years. You would be amazed to see such a small river separates two different countries!! Enjoy every bit your time as this is your last day of game drive for this trip. Have lunch and take a small nap like our Maasai guides. Then proceed towards your camp. On the way back encounter a pride of lion. During your stay at Mara, you would have seen the Big 4 our of the Big 5. The Rhino being very elusive is going to be a difficult find. But this area is know for the Rhinos. If you are lucky you would get to see one. Return to the camp with great memories. Spend you evening at the camp fire before having dinner. Retire for the day. Sadly the holiday has come to an end. But at the end you would release that it was the journey which was so beautiful. Have a blissful night.",
